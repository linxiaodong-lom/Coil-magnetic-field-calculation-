# Coil-magnetic-field-calculation-
This code is used to calculate the magnetic field generated by a pair of coil currents in the same direction
but this code needs to be upgraded because of the long calculation time. 
I divide the coil into 100 current elements and uses Biot-Savart's law to calculate the magnetic fieldï¼Œand also take into account the influence of the coil radius
